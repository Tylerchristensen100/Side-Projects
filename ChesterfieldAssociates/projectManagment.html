                       LIM has built a reputation for effective, comprehensive oversight and management of complex
                       projects. Management is important for all projects; however, large projects require a range of
                       skills and a depth of analysis that we have long provided for clients worldwide. We ensure that
                       planning and management are comprehensive, ongoing efforts involving all participation.

                       Project planning and management are especially critical to the success of projects that are
                       complex, long-term, multisectoral and multinational- as is typical for large development
                       projects. We have built the skills to plan, oversee, organize, and provide financial management
                       for such large projects. We are also sensitive to local conditions that can affect performance,
                       such as culture, politics, government requirements, and competition. We can devise tactical means
                       of dealing with problems such as shortages of finance and lack of infrastructure or appropriate
                       technologies.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Key Skills of Project Management</strong>
                    <p>
                        Effective project management is a multi-dimensional effort that goes far beyond the technical
                        skill areas involved- a fact often overlooked by technical experts. Technical competence must be
                        complemented by financial and interpersonal skills.

                        We put together international teams with skills in planning, financial control, performance
                        measurement, contractual management, communication, evaluation, crisis management, teamwork, and
                        conflict resolution. We have found that an ability to manage change is critical, as is an
                        ability to overcome constraints, complemented by cultural sensitivity. The right project manager
                        combines all of these skills with the ability to communicate well at all levels.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Our Approach: “ No Surprise”</strong>
                    <p>
                        Planning in advance and managing in process are critical and mutually complementary skills. Our
                        approach to our assignment stresses the classic management motto:” No surprises” We plan
                        thoroughly, monitor constantly and utilize feedback. We stress teamwork to ensure that everyone
                        shares the common project objective.

                        In planning a project, we establish a work plan that divides the work into clearly identified
                        segments. The division is based on an analysis of critical activities. These segments are at a
                        level of detail that allows for problems to be identified and resolved early. We specify the
                        expectations and responsibilities for each segment. We have extensive experience suing automated
                        project scheduling and monitoring systems, which allow us to relate each work step to the
                        project budget. At this stage, too, we establish and document relevant policies to guide the
                        rest of the project, and we establish a means of change control.

                        Our project monitoring calls for regular, standardized reporting of time and expense according
                        to the work breakdown structure. We install effective financial recording and reporting
                        processes to ensure that our managers and clients are always current with the state of the
                        project. We assess external factors that may
                        affect the project. When variances to schedule or budget are identified, we use our change
                        control process to account for their effects. Further, we involve our clients at each stage,
                        encouraging their input and keeping them up to date on progress. We also foster teamwork and
                        communication, so that all team members understand the project’s overall goals and how their
                        tasks interrelate.

                        The last important ingredients is feedback. We constantly seek feed back on our products and
                        processes from clients and team members. Feedback also includes our quality assurance mechanism,
                        where all work products are reviewed and critiqued by experienced managers before they are
                        delivered.
