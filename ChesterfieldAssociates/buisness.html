                       Each year thousand of the unwary business owners settle for a price that is based on some formula
                       never realizing that their companies have a clear and definable value, and that their business
                       may be worth more to the right buyer. At LIM we have developed a process that consistently sells
                       more value for our clients’ business, frequently for more money than even the business owner
                       envisioned. LIM consulting is a group of professionals who are merger and acquisition specialist,
                       financial advisors, business sale’s specialist, and deal makers.

                       We consider, a seller’s point of view- an essential value of business. We guide them how to
                       position their business before they begin to sell. A seller has to make its financial structure
                       and growth potential look as attractive as possible to buyers. A seller has to see the sale from
                       the buyer’s eyes. In essence, a seller has to determine the true value of their business or
                       they’ll never be able to know if an offer is high or low. The fact is; that most business owners
                       are unaware of the true value of their business.

                       We also consider, a buyer’s point of view- an essential value of business. We guide them how to
                       buy a lucrative business. Most important, the buyer is buying the future, the business’ growth
                       potential, consistent cash flow and dividend paying capacity. In other words, the buyer is
                       looking for the most important ROI (return on investment).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire process at LIM begins with Quality Evaluations which is made up of several
                        components:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recast Financial</li>
                        <li>Market Research / Packaging</li>
                        <li>Strengths and Weaknesses</li>
                        <li>Deal Structuring</li>
                        <li>Value/ROI for the Buyer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                       Often recasting financial statements substantially increases the apparent earnings of business,
                       which makes them more attractive to potential buyers. Recasting is an acceptable general
                       accounting practice. After recasting a company’s financial record, LIM uses the record to build a
                       projection of the business growth potential a proforma.

                       Packaging comes next. We will suggest changes that will make the business’ appearance as
                       attractive as possible to potential buyers. We consistently check and double check our figures
                       because the information and formulas applied to our clients’ have to be absolutely correct and
                       accurate. If they’re not, they won’t be credible to the buyer.

                       The final step in the evaluation process is deciding on an appropriate deal structure. A deal
                       structure includes future personal needs as well as specific rewards. An optimum deal structure
                       is much more than a cash transaction. Once the evaluations completed, the preliminaries are over,
                       its time to actually sell our clients’ business. That’s where LIM deal maker comes into the
                       picture.

                       From the evaluation report we prepare a confidential detailed review. It’s a detailed guide for
                       qualified buyers, who will have at their fingertips objective information on the value of our
                       clients’ company and documentation of its future value. It’s essential that all for the
                       information in this report be accurate.
                       Otherwise, an owner may risk legal entanglement. The business review should be entirely
                       confidential, in fact your company name will not appear on the document. This is to protect our
                       clients’ from competitors and premature rumors of sale. There are three main steps in selling any
                       business:
                    </p>
                   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prospecting</li>
                        <li>Negotiating</li>
                        <li>Closing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For instance, in prospecting one must first determine the largest number of qualified buyers who
                        would be interested in buying a business. Secondly, knowing the proper contact person and
                        decision maker of the company is essential. It is also very important to know a company’s buying
                        history, how to they put deals together and how they act after the deal is over. In dealing with
                        buyers from other countries, knowing the key contact person can save us endless time and effort.

                        After a group of potential buyers has been prospected, the negotiation process begins.
                        Negotiating is the process whereby you learn the needs of the buyers and any objections to the
                        seller. We serve an important role as a mediator. We work with both sides to make sure all
                        information and needs are understood and properly transmitted.

                        Even after the negotiations are over, the sale is still not assured. Due diligence is a very big
                        part of closing the deal. It is a process whereby the buyer brings in his team of experts;
                        financial, legal and technical to substantiate the representations and information provided to
                        them. If material discrepancies are found, it could put the entire deal in jeopardy.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "italics">The most important things we do as deal makers, is to completely understand the seller’s
                        objectives and help buyer, complete a deal that will satisfy your objectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To define LIM Consulting in a single word would be “professional.” those who do all things with
                        a great deal of enthusiasm and skill which carries an implication of commitment. That is our
                        business -and it is a positive joy to make it happen for the entrepreneur.
