                    LIM’s work in privatization ranges from macroeconomic policy reform required for coherent
                    private sector promotion to valuation and market readiness activities for specific companies and
                    enterprises. Our approach to privatization transactions requires an integrated and management
                    development, trade and investment promotions, and creation of sales and marketing strategy.
                    Thus, in addition to a core group of investment, privatization, and finance specialist,
                    professional from diverse financial, technical, and development disciplines contribute to LIM’s
                    investment and privatization projects.

                    Privatization is an intricate process encompassing a range of options to achieve economic and
                    political goals. At LIM, we define privatization broadly as the transfer of state owned
                    enterprise (SOEs) from the public sector to the private sector. The transfer may result in
                    different levels of private ownership, or it may result in a charge in management, e.g. leases
                    and management contracts.

                    LIM’s can assist at all stages of the privatization process:
                </p>

                <strong>Investment and trade Promotion</strong>
                <p>
                    Investment and trade promotion have become increasingly important issues for developing
                    countries.
                    Faced with balance of payments crises, recurring trade deficits, dwindling foreign exchange
                    reserves, and rising unemployment, national governments have begun to accept the limitations of
                    inward-oriented development strategies, and are adopting policies that encourage foreign and
                    local direct investment, especially in the export sector.

                    We offer a comprehensive and transaction-oriented strategy for foreign investment promotion.

                    Our philosophy is that the agenda of an investment authority should be driven by a comprehensive
                    investment promotion strategy built on the needs of the private sector. Our approach is to
                    combine the reform of investment institutions and their governing laws and regulations with the
                    implementation of targeted promotion programs and the delivery of transaction- related services
                    that seek to link specific investors with the investment needs of a given country.
                </p>
                <strong>Privitization Strategy</strong>
                <p>
                    At the policy level, we assist governments in developing a privatization strategy and help
                    institutions agree on goals. We work with governments to evaluate the benefits and costs of
                    privatization and to balance widespread private ownership against sound corporate governance. We
                    support government efforts to build the privatization ministries and agencies needed to
                    implement action plans. We also advise on the development of a legal framework for the transfer
                    of enterprises.
                </p>
                <strong>Enterprize Selection and Preparation</strong>
                <p>
                    We assist the privatization agencies to identify the enterprises to be sold, prepare sequencing
                    plans, and determine the optimum time frame for sale of each enterpriser. We asses the health of
                    the enterprises, identifying the need of restructuring. We prepare valuations of enterprises and
                    develop a divestiture strategy for each enterprise.
                </p>
                <strong>Enterprize Restructuring</strong>
                <p>
                    We provide enterprise restructuring services either for the entire or for liquidating or
                    spinning off parts of the enterprise.
                </p>
                <strong>Privitization transactions</strong>
                <p>
                    We assist in the preparation of bidding documents for public tenders or auctions, information
                    memoranda for negotiated sales, and prospectuses for public flotations. For mass privatization,
                    we assist in developing systems for the distributions and auction of vouchers. When acting for
                    buyers, we perform due diligence and strategic analysis.
                </p>
                <strong>Post Privitization</strong>
                <p>
                    We assist in the financial and organizational structuring of new companies and help them meet
                    accounting requirements. In addition, we provide tax and investment advice to privatized
                    enterprises.

                    Privatization is usually just one of the components, such as deregulation. We advise on
                    improving the environment for private sector development through the replacement of direct
                    government control with the appropriate regulatory framework. In addition, we help governments
                    institute the best approach to regulation of monopolies.

                    Our staff economist and privatization specialist are supported be a sophisticated computerized
                    recruitment database and experienced administrative support, extending our ability to provide
                    top-quality personnel to meet requests for specialized assistance. Staff ensure delivery of the
                    best available talent for each assignment, along with careful coordination, follow-up, and
                    quality control.

            <p>
                Each year thousand of the unwary business owners settle for a price that is based on some formula
                never realizing that their companies have a clear and definable value, and that their business
                may be worth more to the right buyer. At LIM we have developed a process that consistently sells
                more value for our clients’ business, frequently for more money than even the business owner
                envisioned. LIM consulting is a group of professionals who are merger and acquisition specialist,
                financial advisors, business sale’s specialist, and deal makers.

                We consider, a seller’s point of view- an essential value of business. We guide them how to
                position their business before they begin to sell. A seller has to make its financial structure
                and growth potential look as attractive as possible to buyers. A seller has to see the sale from
                the buyer’s eyes. In essence, a seller has to determine the true value of their business or
                they’ll never be able to know if an offer is high or low. The fact is; that most business owners
                are unaware of the true value of their business.

                We also consider, a buyer’s point of view- an essential value of business. We guide them how to
                buy a lucrative business. Most important, the buyer is buying the future, the business’ growth
                potential, consistent cash flow and dividend paying capacity. In other words, the buyer is
                looking for the most important ROI (return on investment).
            </p>
            <p>
                The entire process at LIM begins with Quality Evaluations which is made up of several
                components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recast Financial</li>
                <li>Market Research / Packaging</li>
                <li>Strengths and Weaknesses</li>
                <li>Deal Structuring</li>
                <li>Value/ROI for the Buyer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Often recasting financial statements substantially increases the apparent earnings of business,
                which makes them more attractive to potential buyers. Recasting is an acceptable general
                accounting practice. After recasting a company’s financial record, LIM uses the record to build a
                projection of the business growth potential a proforma.

                Packaging comes next. We will suggest changes that will make the business’ appearance as
                attractive as possible to potential buyers. We consistently check and double check our figures
                because the information and formulas applied to our clients’ have to be absolutely correct and
                accurate. If they’re not, they won’t be credible to the buyer.

                The final step in the evaluation process is deciding on an appropriate deal structure. A deal
                structure includes future personal needs as well as specific rewards. An optimum deal structure
                is much more than a cash transaction. Once the evaluations completed, the preliminaries are over,
                its time to actually sell our clients’ business. That’s where LIM deal maker comes into the
                picture.

                From the evaluation report we prepare a confidential detailed review. It’s a detailed guide for
                qualified buyers, who will have at their fingertips objective information on the value of our
                clients’ company and documentation of its future value. It’s essential that all for the
                information in this report be accurate.
                Otherwise, an owner may risk legal entanglement. The business review should be entirely
                confidential, in fact your company name will not appear on the document. This is to protect our
                clients’ from competitors and premature rumors of sale. There are three main steps in selling any
                business:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Prospecting</li>
                <li>Negotiating</li>
                <li>Closing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For instance, in prospecting one must first determine the largest number of qualified buyers who
                would be interested in buying a business. Secondly, knowing the proper contact person and
                decision maker of the company is essential. It is also very important to know a company’s buying
                history, how to they put deals together and how they act after the deal is over. In dealing with
                buyers from other countries, knowing the key contact person can save us endless time and effort.

                After a group of potential buyers has been prospected, the negotiation process begins.
                Negotiating is the process whereby you learn the needs of the buyers and any objections to the
                seller. We serve an important role as a mediator. We work with both sides to make sure all
                information and needs are understood and properly transmitted.

                Even after the negotiations are over, the sale is still not assured. Due diligence is a very big
                part of closing the deal. It is a process whereby the buyer brings in his team of experts;
                financial, legal and technical to substantiate the representations and information provided to
                them. If material discrepancies are found, it could put the entire deal in jeopardy.
            </p>
            <p class="italics white">The most important things we do as deal makers, is to completely understand the seller’s
                objectives and help buyer, complete a deal that will satisfy your objectives.
            </p>

                    development. The costs and inefficiencies that resulted from state approaches to economic
                    development are being addressed by government after government. Policy reform in many countries
                    reflects these changing sentiments.

                   LIM has built a reputation for effective, comprehensive oversight and management of complex
                   projects. Management is important for all projects; however, large projects require a range of
                   skills and a depth of analysis that we have long provided for clients worldwide. We ensure that
                   planning and management are comprehensive, ongoing efforts involving all participation.

                   Project planning and management are especially critical to the success of projects that are
                   complex, long-term, multisectoral and multinational- as is typical for large development
                   projects. We have built the skills to plan, oversee, organize, and provide financial management
                   for such large projects. We are also sensitive to local conditions that can affect performance,
                   such as culture, politics, government requirements, and competition. We can devise tactical means
                   of dealing with problems such as shortages of finance and lack of infrastructure or appropriate
                   technologies.
               </p>
               <strong>Key Skills of Project Management</strong>
               <p>
                   Effective project management is a multi-dimensional effort that goes far beyond the technical
                   skill areas involved- a fact often overlooked by technical experts. Technical competence must be
                   complemented by financial and interpersonal skills.

                   We put together international teams with skills in planning, financial control, performance
                   measurement, contractual management, communication, evaluation, crisis management, teamwork, and
                   conflict resolution. We have found that an ability to manage change is critical, as is an
                   ability to overcome constraints, complemented by cultural sensitivity. The right project manager
                   combines all of these skills with the ability to communicate well at all levels.
               </p>
               <strong>Our Approach: “ No Surprise”</strong>
               <p>
                   Planning in advance and managing in process are critical and mutually complementary skills. Our
                   approach to our assignment stresses the classic management motto:” No surprises” We plan
                   thoroughly, monitor constantly and utilize feedback. We stress teamwork to ensure that everyone
                   shares the common project objective.

                   In planning a project, we establish a work plan that divides the work into clearly identified
                   segments. The division is based on an analysis of critical activities. These segments are at a
                   level of detail that allows for problems to be identified and resolved early. We specify the
                   expectations and responsibilities for each segment. We have extensive experience suing automated
                   project scheduling and monitoring systems, which allow us to relate each work step to the
                   project budget. At this stage, too, we establish and document relevant policies to guide the
                   rest of the project, and we establish a means of change control.

                   Our project monitoring calls for regular, standardized reporting of time and expense according
                   to the work breakdown structure. We install effective financial recording and reporting
                   processes to ensure that our managers and clients are always current with the state of the
                   project. We assess external factors that may
                   affect the project. When variances to schedule or budget are identified, we use our change
                   control process to account for their effects. Further, we involve our clients at each stage,
                   encouraging their input and keeping them up to date on progress. We also foster teamwork and
                   communication, so that all team members understand the project’s overall goals and how their
                   tasks interrelate.

                   The last important ingredients is feedback. We constantly seek feed back on our products and
                   processes from clients and team members. Feedback also includes our quality assurance mechanism,
                   where all work products are reviewed and critiqued by experienced managers before they are
                   delivered.
