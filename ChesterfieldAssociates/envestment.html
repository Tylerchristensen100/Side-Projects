                        LIM’s work in privatization ranges from macroeconomic policy reform required for coherent
                        private sector promotion to valuation and market readiness activities for specific companies and
                        enterprises. Our approach to privatization transactions requires an integrated and management
                        development, trade and investment promotions, and creation of sales and marketing strategy.
                        Thus, in addition to a core group of investment, privatization, and finance specialist,
                        professional from diverse financial, technical, and development disciplines contribute to LIM’s
                        investment and privatization projects.

                        Privatization is an intricate process encompassing a range of options to achieve economic and
                        political goals. At LIM, we define privatization broadly as the transfer of state owned
                        enterprise (SOEs) from the public sector to the private sector. The transfer may result in
                        different levels of private ownership, or it may result in a charge in management, e.g. leases
                        and management contracts.

                    <strong>Investment and trade Promotion</strong>
                    <p>
                        Investment and trade promotion have become increasingly important issues for developing
                        countries.
                        Faced with balance of payments crises, recurring trade deficits, dwindling foreign exchange
                        reserves, and rising unemployment, national governments have begun to accept the limitations of
                        inward-oriented development strategies, and are adopting policies that encourage foreign and
                        local direct investment, especially in the export sector.

                        We offer a comprehensive and transaction-oriented strategy for foreign investment promotion.

                        Our philosophy is that the agenda of an investment authority should be driven by a comprehensive
                        investment promotion strategy built on the needs of the private sector. Our approach is to
                        combine the reform of investment institutions and their governing laws and regulations with the
                        implementation of targeted promotion programs and the delivery of transaction- related services
                        that seek to link specific investors with the investment needs of a given country.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Privitization Strategy</strong>
                    <p>
                        At the policy level, we assist governments in developing a privatization strategy and help
                        institutions agree on goals. We work with governments to evaluate the benefits and costs of
                        privatization and to balance widespread private ownership against sound corporate governance. We
                        support government efforts to build the privatization ministries and agencies needed to
                        implement action plans. We also advise on the development of a legal framework for the transfer
                        of enterprises.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Enterprize Selection and Preparation</strong>
                    <p>
                        We assist the privatization agencies to identify the enterprises to be sold, prepare sequencing
                        plans, and determine the optimum time frame for sale of each enterpriser. We asses the health of
                        the enterprises, identifying the need of restructuring. We prepare valuations of enterprises and
                        develop a divestiture strategy for each enterprise.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Enterprize Restructuring</strong>
                    <p>
                        We provide enterprise restructuring services either for the entire or for liquidating or
                        spinning off parts of the enterprise.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Privitization transactions</strong>
                    <p>
                        We assist in the preparation of bidding documents for public tenders or auctions, information
                        memoranda for negotiated sales, and prospectuses for public flotations. For mass privatization,
                        we assist in developing systems for the distributions and auction of vouchers. When acting for
                        buyers, we perform due diligence and strategic analysis.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Post Privitization</strong>
                    <p>
                        We assist in the financial and organizational structuring of new companies and help them meet
                        accounting requirements. In addition, we provide tax and investment advice to privatized
                        enterprises.

                        Privatization is usually just one of the components, such as deregulation. We advise on
                        improving the environment for private sector development through the replacement of direct
                        government control with the appropriate regulatory framework. In addition, we help governments
                        institute the best approach to regulation of monopolies.

                        Our staff economist and privatization specialist are supported be a sophisticated computerized
                        recruitment database and experienced administrative support, extending our ability to provide
                        top-quality personnel to meet requests for specialized assistance. Staff ensure delivery of the
                        best available talent for each assignment, along with careful coordination, follow-up, and
                        quality control.
